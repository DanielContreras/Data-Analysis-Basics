## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of doing data analysis using the Python package, pandas. The basic skills that I will be practicing will be cleaning data for the purpose of our analysis. Things like sorting, filtering, and some data transformations will also be explored. I will also explore the very basics of machine learning using the diamond data set to predict prices by setting up a basic linear regression model.
